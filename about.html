            <h3>Land</h3>
            <p>To go off grid, you need a parcel of land that lends itself to your new lifestyle choice. 
                That will usually mean finding land in a remote area, far from strict building codes and permitting regulations. 
                Land in these areas is less expensive, property taxes are lower, and you can get more acreage for your money.
            </p>

            <h3>Shelter</h3>
            <p>
                This is a fundamental need every human being requires to survive.There are many different types of shelters 
                and it’s a good idea to choose which type of shelter you will build or buy long before moving onto your land.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Water & Water Collection System</h3>
            <p>
                A good clean potable water source is vital for living off the grid. 
                You will most likely not have access to city water or municipal county water sources on your land 
                so you must choose a piece of land that either has a natural water source, or where it’s convenient to haul water.
            </p>

            <h3>Food</h3>
            <p>
                Grow your own food! Since you most likely will not have everyday access to grocery stores and convenience stores to shop for food, 
                you’ll benefit by growing your own in a garden and/or greenhouse.
            </p>

            <h3>Power Generation System</h3>
            <p>
                Since you will not be connected to the power grid, you will need to be able to generate electricity yourself.
                A few 250 Watt solar panels and a good 250-500 Watt wind turbine will probably suffice for most homes depending on how much power you use at once.
            </p>

            <h3>Power Storage System</h3>
            <p>
                This is where it gets expensive as battery technology is kind of lagging behind solar panel technology. 
                Batteries, however, are getting better and are able to store more electricity for longer periods of time more efficiently than ever before.
                All in all, this is a personal choice that you need to make.
            </p>

            <h3>Waste Disposal & Septic System</h3>
            <p>
                You’ll have to have some sort of composting waste disposal system, or you’ll dig a traditional septic system.
                 Either way, you will have to follow local and federal guidelines on waste disposal.
            </p>

            <h3>The Mindset & Will to Live Off The Grid</h3>
            <p>
                Living sustainably takes a solid commitment, sharp focus, and motivation. 
                The self-sufficient lifestyle is at the heart of independence and with that independence comes responsibility, 
                not just for your lifestyle choice, but to your family and those depending on you.
            </p>
